# You have been approached to build software for a Karaoke bar. Specifically, they want you to build a software for checking guests in and out, plus handling songs.

# Your program should be test driven and should be able to:
#
# Create rooms, songs and guests
# Check in guests to rooms/Check out guests from rooms
# Add songs to rooms

  # and point a @bar instance variable to it. This will enable functionality of Bar class object to sell drinks to guests.
