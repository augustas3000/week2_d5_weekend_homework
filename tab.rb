# The term “tab” is short for “tabulation.” When used in a bar or restaurant and the server says they are adding something to your “tab,” they are really saying “let me add that to the tabulation for your bill.”

# Rooms can keep track of the entry fees/spending of the guests - maybe add a bar tab/bar class?



class Bartab

  def initialize(room_obj, guest_obj)
    @room = room_obj
    
  end
